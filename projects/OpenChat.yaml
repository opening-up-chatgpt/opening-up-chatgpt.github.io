# documentation:
code:
    class: partial
    link: https://github.com/imoneoi/openchat/tree/master/ochat
    notes: There is plenty of code in the github repository but only some of it is documented

architecture:
    class: open
    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11235
    notes: Architecture quite well described in preprint

preprint:
    class: open
    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11235
    notes: Preprint describes the model architecture and instruction tuning approach, though is hampered by building on notoriously closed Llama2

paper:
    class: open
    link: https://openreview.net/forum?id=AOJyfhWYHf
    notes: Paper reviewed and accepted for ICLR 2024

modelcard:
    class: partial
    link: https://huggingface.co/openchat/openchat_v3.2
    notes: There is a model card that provides some details on architecture and evaluation

    notes: Datasheet not provided.

# access:
package:
    class: open
    link: https://github.com/imoneoi/openchat/tree/master#installation
    notes: Python package 'ochat' provided through pip

api:
    class: partial
