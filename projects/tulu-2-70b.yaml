# availability:
opencode:
    class: open
    link: https://github.com/allenai/open-instruct
    notes: Important effort to make available fine-tuning procedure and source code. Not seen a repository for base model training yet.

llmdata:
    class: closed
    link:
    notes: Based on Llama2 so nothing known about training data

llmweights:
    class: partial
    link: https://github.com/meta-llama/
    notes: Base model made available via Meta (requires privacy-defying signup)

rldata:
    class: open
    link: https://github.com/allenai/open-instruct
    notes: Codebase used for fine-tuning this model and made available for others

rlweights:
    class: open
    link: https://huggingface.co/allenai/tulu-2-dpo-70b/tree/main
    notes: Fine-tuned weights available

# documentation:
code:
    class: partial
    link: https://github.com/allenai/open-instruct
    notes: OpenInstruct code well-documented

architecture:
    class: partial
    link: https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta
    notes: Post-llama2 aspects quite well described in papers, e.g. DPO based on Zephyr Beta, but base model is irrevocably closed
