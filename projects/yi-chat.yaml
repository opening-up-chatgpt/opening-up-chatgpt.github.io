# availability:
opencode:
    class: partial
    link: https://github.com/01-ai/Yi
    notes: repository contains some code for demos and for instruction tuning, but only sparse examples of code for initial training and model architecture

llmdata:
    class: closed
    link:
    notes: Training data for base model undocumented, though preprint mentions CommonCrawl as one source

llmweights:
    class: open
    link: https://huggingface.co/01-ai/Yi-34B/tree/main
    notes: Base model weights shared via HuggingFace

rldata:
    class: closed
    link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/BAAI/COIG
    notes: Model docs mention COIG but only as an example. Code also shows rm-static is also used in instruction tuning, but not shared.
